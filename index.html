    <h1>Hello Mars! my name is Marcus Porter</h1>
<br>
    <h2>Let me tell you a little bit about myself</h2>

    <h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    I was born in Missouri but I lived in many places growing up including Arkansas, Iowa and Michigan. I spent most of my youth in rural Iowa on a family farm.
</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>
    I love traveling and being outdoors. I also enjoy rock climbing and playing basketball. Because I love to travel, I spent my time in the military saving up enough money to go back-packing Europe for a summer. see a list of the countries I traveld to below.
